# MARKET ANALYSIS
## PROBLEMS STATEMENT
1- Most mid-market and larger accounting applications tend to be sold exclusively through resellers, developers, and consultants. Those organizations generally pass on a license fee to the software vendor and then charge the client for installation, customization, and support services. Clients usually pay roughly 50-200% of the price of the actual software in implementation and consulting fees! That's too Outrageous for small retail stores and companies!!



2- Based on my interaction with business owners, they all want the ability to still track day to day activities even when they are not physically present at their firm, Retail Stores, Company's E.T.C

Track Activities Like:
- Daily Sales
- Product Inventory (To get notified when a product inventory is running low, so as to order for more before it goes out of stock)
- Track Debtors & Debts


# BUSINESS MODEL
 Having the problem statement In Mind, we decided that, We will be using a B2B business model, in this context we sell our SaaS directly to other businesses(small stores and companies) who are the end user.

## PAYMENT
This accounting software will be on a monthly recurring charge instead of a larger upfront license fee (This concept is popularly known as software as a service - SaaS), this is to make it easier and cheaper for anyone to purchase and get started with the software.




# TECHNOLOGY
Having The Problem Statement and business model in mind, and also that our end users typically tend to have one to hundreds of users(employees) accessing a company file at the same time. 

We decided in using the following technologies
## SERVER
Database : 
We will be using the MySQL database to store every company data, because it is very secure, very fast and can handle millions of transactions and thousands of users without them having conflicts with each other.

Framework/Language To Process Data and Implement Server Side Logic : NodeJs/Javascript


## CLIENT

Coming Soon ...
But to give You an idea, we are considering on using Google Flutter Sdk for Desktop client and Mobile client and React for the Web client.
